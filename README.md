### React Calculator

A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.  

I decided to build this after reading an [article](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) about some fun React projects to build. I came up with the cool color scheme through this [pallete generator](https://materialpalette.com). I think it came out pretty well.
